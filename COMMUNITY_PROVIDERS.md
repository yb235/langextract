## Safety Disclaimer

Community plugins are independently developed and maintained. While we encourage community contributions, the LangExtract team cannot guarantee the safety, security, or functionality of third-party packages.

**Before installing any plugin, we recommend:**

- **Review the code** - Examine the source code and dependencies on GitHub
- **Check community feedback** - Read issues and discussions for user experiences
- **Verify the maintainer** - Look for active maintenance and responsive support
- **Test safely** - Try plugins in isolated environments before production use
- **Assess security needs** - Consider your specific security requirements

Community plugins are used at your own discretion. When in doubt, reach out to the community through the plugin's issue tracker or the main LangExtract discussions.
